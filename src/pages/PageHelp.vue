		<h5>How to use Awesome Todo</h5>
    <p>
      Do you often feel overwhelmed by the amount of work you have to do? Do you
      find yourself missing deadlines? Or do you sometimes just forget to do
      something important, so that people have to chase you to get work done?
    </p>
    <p>
      All of these are symptoms of not keeping a proper "To-Watch List." These
      are prioritized lists of all the tasks that you need to carry out. They
      list everything that you have to do, with the most important tasks at the
      top of the list, and the least important tasks at the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      By keeping such a list, you make sure that your tasks are written down all
      in one place so you don't forget anything important. And by prioritizing
      tasks, you plan the order in which you'll do them, so that you can tell
      what needs your immediate attention, and what you can leave until later.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-do lists are essential if you're going to beat work overload. When you
      don't use them effectively, you'll appear unfocused and unreliable to the
      people around you.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you do use them effectively, you'll be much better organized, and
      you'll be much more reliable. You'll experience less stress, safe in the
      knowledge that you haven't forgotten anything important. More than this,
      if you prioritize intelligently, you'll focus your time and energy on
      high-value activities, which will mean that you're more productive, and
      more valuable to your team.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keeping a properly structured and thought-out list sounds simple enough.
      But it can be surprising how many people fail to use them at all, never
      mind use them effectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, it's often when people start to use them effectively and sensibly
      that they make their first personal productivity breakthroughs, and start
      making a success of their careers.
